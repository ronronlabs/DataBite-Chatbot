# DataBite Chatbot

DataBite is a web-based chatbot that simplifies data science and analytics terms with ~100-word explanations, like a dictionary for beginners. Built with Python, Streamlit, and Hugging Face's Inference API, it promotes **Data Democratization** by making complex concepts accessible to all.

## Features
- Answers questions about data science, analytics, and risk (e.g., "What is a neural network?").
- Explains terms in simple, 10-year-old-friendly language.


## Example
- **Q**: "What is a neural network?"
- **A**: "A neural network is like a computer brain. It learns from examples to do things like recognize pictures or predict numbers."
- **Q**: "What is an algorithm?"
- **A**: "An algorithm is like a recipe for your favorite cake. Itâ€™s a set of steps a computer follows to solve a problem."
